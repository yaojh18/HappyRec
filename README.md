# HappyRec

HappyRec is developed based on Python and PyTorch for reproducing and developing recommendation algorithms in a unified,
comprehensive and efficient framework for research purpose.
Our library includes 22 recommendation algorithms, covering four major categories:

+ General Recommendation
+ Sequential Recommendation
+ Context-aware Recommendation
+ Knowledge-based Recommendation

We design a unified and flexible data file format, and a user can apply the provided script to process the original data copy, or simply download the processed datasets
by our team.
